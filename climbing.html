            <h2>How I Started Climbing</h2>
            <img src="/Users/admin/Downloads/rock1.jpg" alt="Description of Image" class="align-right">
            <p>I started climbing consistently in 2019 at Central Rock Gym in Stoneham, MA as a form of physical therapy for a torn meniscus.
                I loved the ability to solve problems on the wall using various methods, and was inspired to spend
                more time in the gym getting stronger. I quickly became a known regular to the staff and setting crew,
                and was eventually offered a job stripping boulders.

            <img src="/Users/admin/Downloads/Rock3.jpg" alt="Description of Image" class="align-right">
            <p>Most of my free time is spent either training to be a better climber myself, or looking for ways to make a living
                from from the sport. Working for ABC Kids Climbing in Boulder, I hope to gain skills as both a coach and climber.
                By working as Outdoor Assistant Guide, I aim to gain traditional climbing as well as guiding skills. One day,
                I would like to have my AMGA Single Pitch Instructor certification.
