                <p>I started climbing consistently in 2019 at Central Rock Gym in Stoneham, MA as a form of physical therapy for a torn meniscus.I loved the ability to solve problems on the wall using various methods, and was inspired to spend
                    more time in the gym getting stronger. I quickly became a known regular to the staff and setting crew,
                    and was eventually offered a job stripping boulders.</p>

                <p>Most of my free time is spent either training to be a better climber myself, or looking for ways to make a living
                    from from the sport. Working for ABC Kids Climbing in Boulder, I hope to gain skills as both a coach and climber.
                    By working as Outdoor Assistant Guide, I aim to gain traditional climbing as well as guiding skills. One day,
                    I would like to have my AMGA Single Pitch Instructor certification.
