                                Developed python project to examine album covers from various artists in an effort to find correlation between colors
                                and album sentiment.
                            </li>
                            <li>Utilized BERT sentiment classifer to classify song lyric sentiment

                    My personal goals are heavily centered around my own climbing and coaching. I'm always eager to learn more
                    about how I can inspire my athletes to try hard both on and off the wall. From working with Team ABC, my aim
                    is to grow as both a coach and climber, utilizing my opportunities to talk and train with other strong athletes 
                    to both improve my own ability, but also gaining useful information about how I can inspire the same love for the sport
                    in athletes I train.

                    Currently, I'm working towards finishing my Information Science degree at CU Boulder, which 
                    I'll be done with December 2024. As I finish my schooling, I'm looking for an internship either here in Boulder,
                    or remote working in the Machine Learning or Data Science industries.
